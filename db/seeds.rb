# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# User.create(name: "Bob Saget", email: "bobbysags@gmail.com", password_digest: "123")

# Drive.create(user_id: 1, start_address: "2075 3rd St, San Francisco, CA 94107", end_address: "633 Folsom St, San Francisco, CA 94107", depart_min: '2016-08-07 00:00:00-00:00', depart_max: '2016-08-08 00:00:00-00:00', seats_available: 3, tolerance: 10, description: "I'm super-cool.")
